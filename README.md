# Iota

Iota is a set of simple react UI components that designed for internal usage in our company, however it's also available as a free and open source project.



## Getting Involved

If you already have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) up and running on you system, running and building Iota will be a straightforward task. After cloning the project, please install dependencies.

```bash
yarn install
```



## Stories

We are using [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) as a development environment for testing and exploring our components. You will need `yarn` again if you want to run the storybook.

```bash
yarn storybook
```
